# Deni Trust System

## Purpose
The trust system reduces fake events and spam by assigning confidence to events and users using verification signals and reputation history.

## Key Ideas
- Events start as draft and are not visible to the public until they meet publish policy.
- Verification signals increase confidence.
- Spam signals decrease confidence and can trigger cooldowns or manual review.
- User reputation affects how quickly their events can be trusted.

## Event States
- Draft: created but not publicly visible
- Pending: awaiting more verification or time based signals
- Published: visible in search and maps
- Limited: visible with reduced reach or warnings
- Rejected: blocked from publishing

## Inputs to Trust Score

### Positive Signals
- Organizer identity verified
- Venue or business link verified
- Community verification from trusted users
- Repeat history of accurate events
- Location consistency checks

### Negative Signals
- Duplicate or near duplicate events
- Mismatched location or suspicious GPS patterns
- Rapid posting bursts
- Reports from other users
- New account with no history

## Reputation
User reputation changes over time based on behavior:
- Accurate events that match real outcomes increase reputation
- Reports and removals decrease reputation
- Cooldowns apply after repeated negative outcomes

## Publish Policy
An event can be published when:
- Confidence score meets threshold, or
- Confidence is borderline but community verification is strong, or
- Moderator override is applied

## Notes
This is an initial design. Thresholds and weights will be tuned using testing data.
